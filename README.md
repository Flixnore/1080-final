# VCV Rack Module

hello

# Install

Download the Rack SDK

Export the environment variable (for me like this): `export RACK_DIR=/home/felix/Downloads/Rack-SDK`

Run `make install`

Open VCV Rack, module should be there

If this doesn't work, see [VCV Rack Plugin Development](https://vcvrack.com/manual/PluginDevelopmentTutorial)
